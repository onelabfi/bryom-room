# Bryom Room

A regulation room for neurodivergent users — built for the Bryom app.

Users pick **how they feel** (not what they want to play) and are routed to a zone that matches their nervous system state. No failure states, no dark patterns, no ads, no IAP.

## Scope

All four zones active. Three items per zone (12 total).

| Zone    | Items                                              | Purpose                                      |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Focus   | Trail Runner · Orb Matcher · Sequence Tap          | Warm up attention without pressure           |
| Calm    | Breathing Light · Flow Lines · Rain Field          | Lower nervous-system volume                  |
| Fidget  | Pop Grid · Spinner · Pattern Drawer                | Somewhere for the hands to go                |
| Release | Troll Blaster · Smash Field · Pulse Burst          | Move pressure out, with automatic cooldown   |

Release games are followed by a **mandatory 30s de-escalation outro** (breathing light) before returning to the zone. Calm and Fidget have no duration cap — users stay as long as they want.

## State-based entry

`/` → "How are you feeling?" → 6 feelings → recommended zone. Users can also skip and pick a zone directly.

Feelings map:
- Overwhelmed → Calm
- Restless → Fidget
- Foggy → Focus
- Tense → Release
- Flat → Focus
- Just browsing → Focus (user can navigate)

## Analytics events (from day 1)

The app emits five events through a registered handler. Until a handler is registered, events are no-ops in prod (and logged in dev).

| Event         | Payload                                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `room_enter`  | `ts`                                                            |
| `zone_enter`  | `ts, zone`                                                      |
| `game_start`  | `ts, zone, game, recommended`                                   |
| `game_end`    | `ts, zone, game, durationMs, completed, reason`                 |
| `state_after` | `ts, zone, game, feeling`                                       |

Register a handler in the host app:

```ts
import { setAnalyticsHandler } from "./lib/analytics";

setAnalyticsHandler((e) => {
  bryomAnalytics.track(e.type, e);
});
```

## Playtest

See **[PLAYTEST.md](./PLAYTEST.md)** for the tester brief.

### Wiring the feedback webhook

In-app feedback (floating "FEEDBACK" pill + post-game "Report something" link) posts to `/api/feedback`. That endpoint forwards to whatever URL you set in the env var `FEEDBACK_WEBHOOK_URL`.

- **Discord** — paste a channel webhook URL. The endpoint sends a `content` field, which Discord renders as-is.
- **Zapier / Make / n8n** — any webhook trigger works. The POST body is JSON with `{ text, context, meta }`.
- **Unset** — feedback returns ok but is not forwarded. Server logs it in dev.

Set the env in Vercel:
```bash
vercel env add FEEDBACK_WEBHOOK_URL production
# paste your webhook URL
vercel deploy --prod
```

## Tech

- Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack)
- Phaser 3 (games, lazy-loaded per scene)
- Tailwind v4 (shell UI)
- Framer Motion (entry transitions, mascot)
- Zustand (sensory settings, localStorage-persisted)

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm run build
npm run lint
```

## Integration into Bryom — three options

### 1. Route drop-in (recommended if Bryom is Next.js)
Copy these into Bryom's repo:

```
app/page.tsx                     → Bryom: app/room/page.tsx
app/room/[zone]/page.tsx         → Bryom: app/room/[zone]/page.tsx
app/room/play/[game]/page.tsx    → Bryom: app/room/play/[game]/page.tsx
components/room/*                → Bryom: components/room/*
lib/sensory.ts, analytics.ts,
  state.ts, orientation.ts       → Bryom: lib/*
games/**                         → Bryom: games/**
```

Then register an analytics handler in Bryom's root layout and swap the placeholder `Mascot.tsx` SVG for the real Bryom reindeer sprites.

### 2. Iframe / WebView embed (fastest)
Just point an iframe or WebView at `https://bryom-room.vercel.app/`. Pass user context via postMessage if needed. Zero code merge.

### 3. Component mount (future)
Extract into a `@onelabfi/bryom-room` npm package. Not built yet — do this only if multiple apps need to embed.

## Orientation

- **Entry ("How are you feeling?") is portrait** — that's how users hold a phone when they open an app.
- **Zones and games are landscape** — more room for the play field.
- Portrait warning only shows on landscape routes. Entry never nags.
- On desktop browsers (≥900px), everything renders inside a phone-shaped preview frame so the room can be reviewed on a laptop.

## Sensory guarantees

- **No failure states.** Soft fades and mascot reactions only.
- **Motion cap** (low/medium/high) scales game speeds.
- **Warm tint** overlay for light sensitivity.
- **Haptics** can be disabled globally.
- **Session caps.** Release games hard-cap at 90s.
- **No flashing > 3Hz.**
- **Phaser audio is muted by default** until user interaction (Web Audio).

## Skin — everything is swappable

This repo ships with **placeholder graphics** so the room works end-to-end before Bryom's art lands. Every visual is designed to be replaced with the Bryom skin:

| Element               | Where to swap                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reindeer mascot       | `components/room/Mascot.tsx` — swap the SVG for sprite art      |
| Game sprites          | `games/focus/*` and `games/release/*` — replace `scene.add.circle/rectangle` calls with loaded textures |
| Zone accent colors    | `lib/state.ts` → `ZONE_META[zone].accent`                       |
| Background / tokens   | `app/globals.css` → `--bg`, `--bg-soft`, `--accent-*`           |
| Phone-frame preview   | `components/room/PhoneFrame.tsx` — desktop-only, drops out on phones |

Mascot API: `<Mascot size={number} mood="idle | happy | sleepy | cheer" />`.

## Roadmap

- [x] Focus + Release zones (Phase 0)
- [x] Calm + Fidget zones (Phase 1) — 3 items each
- [ ] Fill out to 5 items per zone (original design: 20 total)
- [ ] Replace placeholder reindeer with Bryom sprite pack
- [ ] Wire analytics handler to Bryom's existing pipeline
- [ ] PWA manifest + iOS standalone support
- [ ] Per-game tutorials (one-tap skippable)
- [ ] Zone recommendation learning from `state_after` feedback
